An opensourced packet generator can be find in the project of [PacketGenerator](https://github.com/NetFPGA/netfpga/wiki/PacketGenerator), the packet data can be read from PCAP files.

The key contribution in PL part is the Dispatch module that is combined from source files (1)input_arb.v, (2)crossbar.v and (3)selector.v.

Also we implemented the key module in SS, the module of (1)MMU.v.


Besides, other important modules are the data BUS converter and the output BUS: (1)c8to512.v, (2)lookup.v.

Use cases are implemented in files: (1)statefull.v (2)ndp48.v (3)ndpqs.v (4)measure.v


The SA-based heuristic algorithm is following the processing graph below.

The algorithm is implemented in heuristic.py file.

The defination of the evaluation function, J(wâ€™):
